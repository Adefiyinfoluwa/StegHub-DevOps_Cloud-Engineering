# Introduction

__This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The SDLC outlines the various phases a software project undergoes, from initial concept to final deployment and ongoing maintenance.__

## What is SDLC?
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process development teams use to design and build high-quality software. SDLC aims to minimise project risks through planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process into tasks you can assign, complete, and measure.

## Why is SDLC important?
  - Increased visibility of the development process for all stakeholders involved.
- Efficient estimation, planning, and scheduling.
- Improved risk management and cost estimation.
- Systematic software delivery and better customer satisfaction.



## How does SDLC work?
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) outlines several tasks required to build a software application. The development process goes through several stages as developers add new features and fix bugs in the software.

The details of the SDLC process vary for different teams. However, we outline some common SDLC phases below.

### Plan

The planning phase typically includes tasks like cost-benefit analysis, scheduling, resource estimation, and allocation. The development team collects requirements from several stakeholders such as customers, internal and external experts, and managers to create a software requirement specification document.
The document sets expectations and defines common goals that aid in project planning. The team estimates costs, creates a schedule, and has a detailed plan to achieve their goals.

### Design
In the design phase, software engineers analyze requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software. For example, they may consider integrating pre-existing modules, make technology choices, and identify development tools. They will look at how to best integrate the new software into any existing IT infrastructure the organization may have.

### Implement

In the implementation phase, the development team codes the product. They analyze the requirements to identify smaller coding tasks they can do daily to achieve the final result.

### Test
The development team combines automation and manual testing to check the software for bugs. Quality analysis includes testing the software for errors and checking if it meets customer requirements. Because many teams immediately test the code they write, the testing phase often runs parallel to the development phase.

### Deploy
When teams develop software, they code and test on a different copy of the software than the one that the users have access to. The software that customers use is called production, while other copies are said to be in the build environment, or testing environment.
Having separate build and production environments ensures that customers can continue to use the software even while it is being changed or upgraded. The deployment phase includes several tasks to move the latest build copy to the production environment, such as packaging, environment configuration, and installation.

### Maintain
In the maintenance phase, among other tasks, the team fixes bugs, resolves customer issues, and manages software changes. In addition, the team monitors overall system performance, security, and user experience to identify new ways to improve the existing software.

__Conclusion__

The SDLC provides a structured approach to software development, ensuring a high-quality product is delivered efficiently while minimizing risks. By following a defined SDLC methodology, development teams can create software that meets user needs and achieves project goals.
